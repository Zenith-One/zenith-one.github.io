### Communities

> COMMUNITIES
> - We are few in number in this accursed land. Most rarely have contact with anyone outside our own small steading or village, and strangers are viewed with deep suspicion.
> - We live in communities called circles. These are settlements ranging in size from a steading with a few families to a village of several hundred. Some circles belong to nomadic folk. Some powerful circles might include a cluster of settlements. We trade (and sometimes feud) with other circles.
> - We have forged the Ironlands into a home. Villages within the Havens are connected by well-trod roads. Trade caravans travel between settlements in the Havens and those in outlying regions. Even so, much of this land is untamed.

One of the things I really like about this worldbuilding system is that it's full of levers and dials that you can tweak to end up with wildly different settings.  Do you want to play in a world where the people live in small, insular groups? Or would you prefer something more akin to clans? Or, are you more interested in the dynamics that cities and trade can give you? 

If this game were going to be happening more directly after the great war, the first option would probably be the best one. I think instead it will happen as dwarven society is just starting to get back on its feet. We definitely aren't back to a place where the land is tamed again.

Not too hard and not too soft. The middle option is just right.

### Leaders

So we have middling communities, which are maybe collections of dwarven clans.
You can learn a great deal about a culture based on how they govern themselves, though.

> LEADERS
> - Leadership is as varied as the people. Some communities are governed by the head of a powerful family. Or, they have a council of elders who make decisions and settle disputes. In others, the priests hold sway. For some, it is duels in the circle that decide.
> - Each of our communities has its own leader, called an overseer. Every seventh spring, the people affirm their current overseer or choose a new one. Some overseers wear the iron circlet reluctantly, while others thirst for power and gain it through schemes or threats.
> - Numerous clan-chiefs rule over petty domains. Most are intent on becoming the one true king. Their squabbles will be our undoing.

Up to this point, I've had a pretty easy time figuring out which option I wanted to pick.
These are all very exciting choices.
One of them even has "clan" in it!
This is going to be a tough call, so let's think through them one by one.

#### Leadership is varied...
The first option could give us a pretty broad pallette with which to paint our story.
In one village, there might be some akin to a mayor, elected by his people.
Nearby we might find a valley with several villages all ruled by a despot.

Pros: Lots of potential for variety

Cons: I like the idea of having generally understood customs and expectations that Ida can work with.

#### Each community has an elected leader

This one has a distinctly orderly feel to it, and it gels with my mental model of what these dwarves are like. Maybe this form of government is a cultural hold-over from the time before the war? It feels fairly enlightened. On the other hand, the dwarven lands are quite expansive and it's difficult to imagine that *everyone* ended up with the same structure.

Pros: Consistent with what I think a nascent cultural revival might look like, and I can see this form of government providing the springboard the dwarves need to start climbing back to where they used to be.

Cons: Perhaps a little *too* consistent.

#### Clan-chiefs

Really, the only thing going for this one in my mind is that it has "clan" in it. I think it's definitely possible that this might be where this young civilization will end up in the future, it's a little early for it now. Also, I think there's more than enough danger to be had without folks fighting over land. Land which we've already established is rich in resources, no less.

Pros: for this setting, almost none.

Cons: all of them.

#### Decision

The most interesting option to me is a marriage of the first two choices: 

> Most of our communities are governed by their own leader, called an overseer. As our traditions from before the war dictate, every seventh spring, the people affirm their current overseer or choose a new one. Some overseers wear the iron circlet reluctantly, while others thirst for power and gain it through schemes or threats.
>
> Not everyone chooses to follow the old ways, though.
There are places ruled by warlords.
There are wandering clans whose leadership is decided by combat.
There are even rumors of a group that lives high in the peaks whose leader is chosen by a sacred bird.

I like this because it gives me most of the pros, yet mitigates the cons.  That's what we'll go with.
