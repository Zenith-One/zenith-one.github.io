        In Part I, we discussed what the land is like, and a bit of history. Then we learned some important things about our people in Part II.

In this, our final piece of worldbuilding, we will learn about other peoples and dangers with which our freshly conceived dwarven society will have to contend. As we will learn,...<br>

        I think that it will be easier to get a good picture of who our protagonist will be if we first understand where she is coming from, in the literal sense. Ironsworn has a built-in setting with a nice set of options for several decision points on the specifics. I really like the way it’s set up, but I think I’d prefer to play in my group’s homebrew setting, Kalemin, instead. Since I and my...<br>
