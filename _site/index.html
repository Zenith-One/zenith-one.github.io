        <p>In <a href="/worldbuilding-part-i-the-land">Part I</a>, we discussed what the land is like, and a bit of history.
Then we learned some important things about our people in <a href="worldbuilding-part-ii-the-people">Part II</a>.
Definitely check those out if you missed them, because they will inform many decisions we make moving forward.</p>

        <p>Welcome to the second part of our worldbuilding series in which we are, as Bob Ross would put it, making some big decisions.
If you missed Part I, I recommend <a href="/worldbuilding-part-i-the-land/">checking it out</a>.
It might be confusing otherwise.</p>

        <p>I think that it will be easier to get a good picture of who our protagonist will be if we first understand where she is coming from, in the literal sense.
Ironsworn has a built-in setting with a nice set of options for several decision points on the specifics.
I really like the way it’s set up, but I think I’d prefer to play in my group’s homebrew setting, Kalemin, instead.
Since I and my group created it, I know that setting fairly well. I also know that there are still many blank spots in the lore and the map to explore.
As I was reading through the world creation options, though, I discovered a pleasant surprise: If I set up the game at the right place in the right time, I don’t even have to do much editing.</p>

        <p>Welcome to From the Ashes, an Ironsworn blog.  Ironsworn is a Powered by the Apocalypse game created by Shawn Tomkin. It was designed from the ground up to be played in several different ways: Guided (with a GM), cooperatively (multiple players without a GM), or solo (single player, no GM). This blog will contain accounts of solo gameplay by yours truly.</p>
