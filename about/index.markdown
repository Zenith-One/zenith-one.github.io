It all began when I was 12 (which is further in the rear-view than I would prefer to consider). My dad showed me a new thing he had found called QBasic. I played with it for hours, looking through the massive QBasic By Example tome.  In the end, I had a handful of example programs, one which played a song from my favorite video game at the time on the computer speaker, and a developing love for programming.

Now, decades later, with several years of professional experience behind me, that passion is still alive, and the voracious apetite for learning new things is very much still a big part of who I am.  Although many other nouns take prominent positions in describing who I am (husband, father, volunteer), the journey I began at 12 has left its indelible mark on me. I am the guy who codes.
